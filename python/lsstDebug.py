class Info(object):
    """An object cognisant of debugging parameters appropriate for module "name"; any request for a value
will return False unless that value has been set, either in the module or as an attribute of this object.

E.g.
    import lsstDebug

    display = lsstDebug.Info(__name__).display
will set display to False, unless display has been set with
    lsstDebug.Info(__name__).display = True

Why is this interesting?  Because you can replace lsstDebug.Info with your own version, e.g.

import lsstDebug

def DebugInfo(name):
    di = lsstDebug.getInfo(name)        # N.b. lsstDebug.Info(name) would call us recursively
    if name == "foo":

    to frame numbers, as shown in the `lsstDebug.Info` example. Given such a dictionary, this function
    extracts and returns the appropriate frame number. If `debugDisplay` is not a collection, or if
    `name` is not found within it, we return `None`.
